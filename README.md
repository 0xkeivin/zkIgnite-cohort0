# zkIgnite-cohort0

## overview
1. Typescript support
- zkApps written in SnarkyJS
- can run proofs in browser
2. Unlimited off-chain computation
- execute zkApps off-chain, privately and send ZK proof on-chain
- can generate batches of proofs into single proof

## Setup
- https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli
```
npm install -g zkapp-cli
```

## zkApps
- up to 8 fields of on-chain state each storing 32 bytes of arbitrary data
- `proof authorization` allows users to alter zkApp account state if transaction is generated by zkApp
- `Signature authorization` allows whomever deployed the smart contract to edit it (owner only?)
- **inputs** passed to smart contract is private ! (only zkApp can see it)
